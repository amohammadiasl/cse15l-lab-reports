# Lab report 4
### Step 1: Log into ieng6
#### SSH into my username
I typed in "ssh" and then typed my username "cs15lfa23ay@ieng6.ucsd.edu" and finally pressed `<enter>` to log onto ieng6. <br>

I was prompted to enter my passowrd although I already have my save key (I am guessing this is because I was on my home connection. I had the same issues at UCSD until I logged into UCSD_Protected). I typed in "*******" then pressed `<enter>` and got logged in. <br>

### Step 2: Clone the fork using the `SSH` link <br>

<br>
I copied the `SSH` URL from my forked repo on Github, using `<Ctrl>` `c`, and the typed `git clone` into the terminal and pasted the URL with `<Ctrl>` `v` and finally pressed `<enter>` to clone the repository.

I then typed `cd` and `lab7` and pressed `<enter>` to change into the lab7 directory.
<br>
### Step 3: Run the tests to demonstrate they fail
In this step, I typed in `ls` and pressed `<enter>` to display the files in the current directory. Once I found the file that I needed (test.sh), I typed `bash<space>test.sh` and pressed `<enter>` to run the tests within the bash file. The reason I typed `bash` is because `test.sh` essentially is a shortcut to run the java file `ListExamplestests` which has a series of `junit` tests, written to test the correctness of `ListExamples`. <br>
