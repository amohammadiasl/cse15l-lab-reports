I was prompted to enter my passowrd although I already have my save key (I am guessing this is because I was on my home connection. I had the same issues at UCSD until I logged into UCSD_Protected). I typed in "*******" then pressed `<enter>` and got logged in. <br>

I copied the `SSH` URL from my forked repo on Github, using `<Ctrl>` `c`, and the typed `git clone` into the terminal and pasted the URL with `<Ctrl>` `v` and finally pressed `<enter>` to clone the repository.
